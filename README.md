# FastLacellsGenerator
Simple script to quickly generate lacells.db cell database for the
[Local-GSM-Backend project by n76](https://github.com/n76/Local-GSM-Backend).

Uses both Mozilla Location Service and OpenCellID databases as source.

### Usage
All parameters are defined as script variables and described inside. Create
your own configuration based on the `config.sample` file: after copying it
to `config`, adjust the values to reflect your needs.

This script is based on [lacells-creator by wvengen and n76](https://github.com/n76/lacells-creator).
